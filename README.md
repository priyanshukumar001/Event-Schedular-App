# Event Scheduling App

## Description

This is an event scheduling app built with React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The app has two different interfaces:

1. **User Interface**: Users can select their available dates and time slots from a calendar UI. This information is sent to the backend in a proper format.
2. **Admin Interface**: Admins can access user data, assign fixed schedules, and manage user profiles, upcoming schedules, and user lists. The admin dashboard allows adding new schedules to users, with background checks to avoid time conflicts.
